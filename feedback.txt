Feedback on the 4003-243 Project 2: 

Course: 	CS3 (Object-Oriented Programming)

My name is: 	Jenny Zhen

My account is: 	jxz6853

What did you learn by doing this assignment?

	I learned how to separate my project into more organized formats using the 
	MVC. I improved my skills in GUI design and programming in Java overall. I 
	learned that writing a complete application takes more effort than I 
	initially thought.


What was easy about this assignment?

	The model was easier than the GUI. However, this was the second GUI that 
	I've written in Java.


What was harder than you originally thought?

	Writing the GUI and paying attention to or remembering all the tiny details 
	listed in the project documentations. I had to rewrite a lot of code since 
	I was working without an internet connection half the time.


What can the instructor do to improve this assignment?

	I didn't like the fact that I couldn't add additional buttons. I feel that 
	a modern day ATM should have an improved design. Also, a clearer description 
	of how an ATM looks like would help. I've never used one before.


What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

	I would've liked to improve the design of the GUI.


What other issues would you like to discuss?

	I don't have any other issues that I'd like to discuss.
